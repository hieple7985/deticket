## Quickstart

### Deploying the Smart Contract

To deploy the Smart Contract, go to the contract folder and configure a `.env` file with the following env vars:

```
RPC_URL=https://ithacanet.smartpy.io/
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_TEZOS_PRIVATE_KEY>
ADMIN_ADDRESS=<THE_ADMIN_ADDRESS>
METADATA_URL=https://example.com/metadata
```
The Admin does not necessarily need the same account as the deployer and he has the following powers:
- Withdraw the Smart Contract balance
- Check/Uncheck a ticket collection as verified

## Building the API

On the `api` folder create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:55432/deticket?schema=public"
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=foo
INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET=bar
```

Use the same contract address that you deployed on the first step.

Also, for build you have to install npm packages and run build:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

And to start it for production just run `npm run start`


## Building the Webapp

On the `webapp` folder create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api
```

Use the same contract address that you deployed on the first step.

Also, for build you have to install npm packages and run build:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

After that, you'll have a `build` folder that you can use to upload to any static host.
